# DNA-Compression-Visualization-Tool-
DNA Compression &amp; Visualization Tool 🧬  A Python-based mini project demonstrating DNA sequence compression and decompression using Run Length Encoding (RLE). This project features a Tkinter GUI and interactive graphs for visualization, making it easy to understand and visually appealing.  Features  Compress DNA sequences (A, T, C, G) using RLE.  
Features-

Compress DNA sequences (A, T, C, G) using RLE.

Decompress sequences back to original form.

Shows compression efficiency with warnings if compression is not effective.

Interactive bar graphs:

Original vs Compressed sequence length

Base frequency of DNA sequence

User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.

Input validation to allow only valid DNA sequences.

Sample Usage

Enter DNA sequence in the input box.

Click Compress → get compressed sequence and visual graphs.

Click Decompress → restore original sequence.

Example:

Input: AAAATTTCCGG
Compressed: A4T3C2G2
Decompressed: AAAATTTCCGG

Tech Stack
